## 🔁 Transaction Management

Each service method uses `@Transactional` with appropriate **propagation** and **isolation** levels:

| Operation      | Propagation         | Isolation          |
|----------------|---------------------|--------------------|
| Create User    | REQUIRED            | SERIALIZABLE       |
| Deposit        | REQUIRED + AOP Log  | READ_COMMITTED     |
| Withdraw       | REQUIRED + AOP Log  | READ_COMMITTED     |
| Transfer       | REQUIRED + AOP Log  | REPEATABLE_READ    |
| Get Balance    | SUPPORTS (Read-only)| DEFAULT            |
